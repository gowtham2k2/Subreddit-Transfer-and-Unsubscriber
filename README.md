# Guide to Transfer your subreddits and users

All your subscribed ( joined ) subreddits and users will be transferred to your new or another account. Don't worry it copies them not moves.

## Step 1:
Go to this [Reddit link](https://old.reddit.com/subreddits/) with your old account.

## Step 2:
open your browser dev tools and go to the console tab ( for chrome/edge/brave press F12 ). if you see any red errors don't worry just ingnore it.

## Step 4:
you will get a link like this, if you have subscribed to more than 100 subreddits you will get multiple links. For example, 1000 subreddits will generate 10 links.

## Step 5:
Right-click on the generated links and select "copy link address". Don't do CTRL+C and CTRL+V  this link is Shortned by the browser

## Step 6:
paste them in a different browser's address bar where your new account is logged in. If you have multiple links then paste them one by one in new tabs. For example 10 links = 10 tabs. All the new subreddit will have green join buttons, common subreddits of two accounts will have red leave button

Tip: If you don't have a second browser just open an incognito tab and login into your new account where you want to transfer those subreddits.

Here I switched from Edge ( old account ) to Chrome ( new account ).

## Step 7:
copy and paste this [code](https://github.com/RaghavanVdy/Subreddit-Transfer-and-Unsubscriber/blob/main/auto%20subscriber.js) in the console tab and click enter (Second browser/ incognito tab). If you have multiple links do this same step in all those links.
